# Machine Attacks Subtitles
This is a community project to fix the subtitles for Machine Attacks.

### How does this work?
---
Each map's subtitles are listed in their own .cfg file. The lines found in these files will directly override the ones shown in the game.

### I want to make a change!
---
If you wish to make a change to the subtitles, [fork](https://github.com/TitanTF/Machine-Attacks-Subtitles/fork) this repository and edit on your forked repository. Then make a pull request to this repository. We will review the changes accordingly.

Only edit the files within the `Updated` folder.
